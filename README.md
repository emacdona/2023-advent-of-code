My solutions to 2023 Advent of Code.

We'll see how many I find time to complete.

## How to use

# Do whatever you need to do to install asdf and quicklisp in your CL implementation. Perhaps no action is required!
# Follow the instructions in the 'advent-of-code-2023.conf' file (adjust paths for your project's location). This will tell asdf how to load this system.
# At the REPL: (ql:quickload "advent-of-code-2023")
# run the tests:
  # (in-package #:tests)
  # (run!)
# Navigate to other packages, run functions, etc.

## License

I'm not sure.
