My solutions to 2023 Advent of Code.

We'll see how many I find time to complete.

## How to use

* Do whatever you need to do to install asdf and quicklisp in your CL implementation. Perhaps no action is required!
* Follow the instructions in the 'advent-of-code-2023.conf' file (adjust paths for your project's location). This will tell asdf how to load this system.
* At the REPL: (ql:quickload "advent-of-code-2023")
* run the tests:
  * (in-package #:tests)
  * (run!)
* Navigate to other packages, run functions, etc.

## License

I'm not sure.
